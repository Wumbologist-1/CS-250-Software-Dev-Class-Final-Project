### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs begins with fully understanding the problems users face and the outcomes they hope to achieve. Throughout this course, writing effective **user stories** helped me break down those needs into actionable tasks by focusing on the perspective of the user:  
> *“As a user, I want to… so that…”*  

This structure clarified not only what the system should do, but why that functionality matters. Creating user stories allowed me to stay aligned with user expectations and prioritize work based on what would bring the most value. It also ensured that I was always thinking about features from the end-user's point of view, not just from a technical standpoint. This approach made the development process more targeted, reducing the risk of feature creep and focusing on solutions that genuinely meet user needs.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to program development now centers on **incremental progress, continuous feedback, and adaptability**—the core principles of Agile. I plan to continue using key Agile processes such as:  
- **Sprint Planning**  
- **Daily Scrums**  
- **Sprint Reviews**  
- **Sprint Retrospectives**  

These processes help break large projects into smaller, manageable pieces and foster regular communication with stakeholders. One practice I found particularly valuable was the **retrospective**, where the team reflects on what went well and what could be improved. This cycle of feedback and iteration not only enhances the product but also strengthens team collaboration. Moving forward, I hope to always incorporate **backlog refinement** and maintain open communication to allow flexibility as project needs evolve.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means more than simply completing tasks—it involves **active communication, accountability, and collaboration**. This course highlighted the importance of transparency, whether that was sharing blockers during Daily Scrums or providing constructive feedback during Sprint Reviews.  

Good team members:  
- Listen actively  
- Respect others’ contributions  
- Adapt their work to support the collective success of the team  
- Foster trust and open dialogue  

Practicing empathy and understanding different team roles—from Product Owner to Tester—helped me appreciate how interconnected our work is. By working collaboratively and maintaining open lines of communication, I’ve learned that the strength of the team directly impacts the quality and success of the final product.
